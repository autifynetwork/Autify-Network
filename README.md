We are developing a revolutionary trust protocol that leverages the power of blockchain and AI to increase transparency in the global supply chain and retail industry. We aim to eliminate the inefficiencies currently plaguing and are poised to transform commerce and supply chain operations for businesses worldwide. 

Our product is tackling a highly complex issue that has a significant impact on companies & individuals globally. The supply chain inefficiencies, counterfeiting, and lack of transparency in this industry have resulted in losses exceeding $5 trillion annually.

**Supply chain management:**

We are building an end-to-end supply chain management platform for businesses to manage the flow of goods and services from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Our platform will provide real-time visibility into the movement of goods and enable businesses to quickly adapt to changes in demand or supply. They can also help reduce costs and improve efficiency by automating routine tasks and streamlining workflows.

**Supply chain traceability:**

We are building a supply chain traceability platform to track the provenance of goods, including their origin, movement, and ownership. This can help to prevent counterfeiting and ensure the authenticity and quality of products. Our Platform will make it possible for different actors along the supply chain to have different roles and privileges.

We will keep a permanent and immutable record of transactions, which can help to prevent fraud, tampering, and errors in supply chain data. Supply chain participants can reduce the time and cost associated with tracking and verifying the authenticity of goods, and improve the efficiency of supply chain operations.

In addition to the supply chain management and traceability platform, we are also building several other innovative products:

**Sustainability track and trace:** Our sustainability track and trace solution will allow companies to track the environmental and social impact of their supply chains, including carbon emissions, water usage, and labour standards. By providing transparent and verifiable sustainability data, we can help companies meet their sustainability goals and improve their reputation with consumers.

**Autify Verified Vendors Marketplace:** Our verified vendorâ€™s marketplace will provide a trusted platform for companies to find and connect with verified suppliers and service providers. By using blockchain-based identity verification and reputation scoring, we can ensure the reliability and quality of our vendors and simplify the procurement process for our clients.

**API Platform for eCommerce platforms:** Our API platform will enable eCommerce platforms to integrate our blockchain-based traceability and sustainability solutions into their existing systems. This will allow eCommerce companies to provide greater transparency and value to their customers, while also enhancing their own sustainability and traceability efforts.

**Integrating AI and Computer Vision for item tracking:** We are leveraging the power of AI and computer vision to improve item tracking and identification within the supply chain. This will enable us to provide more accurate and efficient traceability solutions and help our clients to reduce losses and improve inventory management.

**B2B Cross Border Payment Module:** Our cross-border payment platform will allow businesses to make secure and efficient payments across borders. By eliminating intermediaries and reducing transaction costs, we can help businesses to expand their global reach and streamline their international operations.
