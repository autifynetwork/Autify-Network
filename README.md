Todayâ€™s global market sees consumers purchasing products both on retail and online platforms, many a time without sufficient information about the authenticity of the product. Most consumers receive little to no information with regards to how the product was made, where the product is from or if it could be a possible replica when they make a purchase. The burning issue is the limited transparency and the absence of a tamper-proof way to determine the authenticity of the product.

Autify Network is developing a trust protocol to make commerce and supply-chain more transparent through the power of Blockchain, AI & Computer vision.
