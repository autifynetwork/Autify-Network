We are developing a revolutionary trust protocol that leverages the power of blockchain and AI to increase transparency in the global supply chain and retail industry. We aim to eliminate the inefficiencies currently plaguing and are poised to transform commerce and supply chain operations for businesses worldwide. 

Our product is tackling a highly complex issue that has a significant impact on companies & individuals globally. The supply chain inefficiencies, counterfeiting, and lack of transparency in this industry have resulted in losses exceeding $5 trillion annually.

**Supply chain management:**

We are building an end-to-end supply chain management platform for businesses to manage the flow of goods and services from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Our platform will provide real-time visibility into the movement of goods and enable businesses to quickly adapt to changes in demand or supply. They can also help reduce costs and improve efficiency by automating routine tasks and streamlining workflows.

**Supply chain traceability:**

We are building a supply chain traceability platform to track the provenance of goods, including their origin, movement, and ownership. This can help to prevent counterfeiting and ensure the authenticity and quality of products. Our Platform will make it possible for different actors along the supply chain to have different roles and privileges.

We will keep a permanent and immutable record of transactions, which can help to prevent fraud, tampering, and errors in supply chain data. Supply chain participants can reduce the time and cost associated with tracking and verifying the authenticity of goods, and improve the efficiency of supply chain operations.
